				data-bs-title="The gas tube of a Bunsen Burner carries pressurised gas, normally methane, to the burner. This tube is normally attached to the gas valve, which releases a steady, controlled flow of gaseous gas into the burner. The tube is connected to the burner at the bottom, and ensures that the gas and oxygen from the oxygen valve are evenly mixed before it is burned. In addition, this tube is often made of rubber, which helps prevent gas leakages."

This valve contains a screw mechanism, which allows for controlled oxygen release into the burner. The oxygen valve is one of two ways to control the flame’s size, the other way being the gas valve. In addition, the oxygen valve is one of the key components for creating a successful flame, as it controls the amount of oxygen that enters the burner, thereby influencing the size of the flame."
