# mRNA 101

This is a pretty basic site I built for my Scientific Storytelling Project from
the Future Science Leaders class. Nothing fancy here, just some Bootstrap,
custom-designed images, and plain ol' HTML/CSS.

I'm not a scientist or medical professional so no guarantees that the
information provided here is accurate. That being said, I have tried to research
to the best of my ability; if you find something inaccurate or have something to
add, feel free to 
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/mrna101/issues).

**TODO:**
- [x] Fix padding issues
- [x] Slight responsiveness fixes
- [x] Add footnotes
- [x] Add personal links + better resource links
