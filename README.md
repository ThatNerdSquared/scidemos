# SciDemos

Scientific communication is something I'm passionate about. To that end,
SciDemos is a collection of small webpages I've built to explain concepts
related science and scientific thinking in a simple, usually interactive way.

While I haven't done a ton related to this yet, I hope to expand it more in the
future. The pages here so far are usually small hobby projects or content I
created as part of my studies. Most assets are custom-designed; those that
aren't have been credited accordingly.

I'm not a scientist or medical professional, so I can't guarantee that the
information provided here is accurate. That being said, I have tried to research
to the best of my ability; if you find something inaccurate or have something to
add, feel free to [open an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/scidemos/issues).
